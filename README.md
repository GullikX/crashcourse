Self driving car simulation using Godot engine

Clone the repo and import the 'project.godot' file using Godot 3.1 or later.

The automatic steering is dependent on the aspect ratio of the window. Snapping the window to the left or right half of a 16:9 screen should make it work with the current parameters.
